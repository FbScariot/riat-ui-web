    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

                        &lt;/tbody&gt;
                    &lt;/table&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2. From the Temporary Voluntary Service: Campaign “RIAT Against COVID-19” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.1. The Coronavirus pandemic also brings with it a mental health epidemic. As a mental health company that was born in Argentina and also operates in Brazil, RIAT is restless and always asks itself what it can do in addition to the usual services to contribute to the community. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.2. For this reason, a psychological assistance service was developed with a team of mental health professionals, with assistance for 24 (twenty-four) hours a day, to receive calls, messages, audios or other forms of contact with cases of people who need this service and support. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.3. Through the platform, a screening is carried out and the type of assistance required is determined, immediately prioritizing emotional restraint and relevant information for each user. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.4. After the screening described in clause 2.3, RIAT identifies the type of specialized professional that will assist the User. The service is done virtually and with prior appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.5. The service provided by RIAT and its Volunteers, here called Service Providers, will have a duration of 03 (three) months from the launch and availability of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.6. After this period has expired, RIAT's activities will continue to be remunerated, within the limits established and determined by its articles of association and regulatory bodies. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.7. RIAT clarifies that after the end of the “RIAT Against Covid-19” Campaign, registered Volunteers will have the option of registering as Professional Service Providers, which will be remunerated as explained in a later Term of Use to be adhered to. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.8. RIAT also clarifies that the User is granted the right to remain linked to the platform after the end of the “RIAT Against Covid-19” campaign, a circumstance which must also adhere to the specific Terms of Use for patients. &lt;/ p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.9. RIAT informs that the service performed by it, whether to serve the purposes of its corporate purpose or for the specific voluntary purpose of the “RIAT Contra Covid-19” campaign, does not constitute any type of advertising or publicity by professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 2.10. Pursuant to clause 2.9, RIAT informs that it does not advertise or advertise the professionals or services they provide and acts within the rules of the bodies regulating its activity. &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 3. Acceptance of the Terms of Use &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 3.1. The Service Provider who accesses the &lt;em&gt;website&lt;/em&gt; or RIAT application or its content, as well as filling in the forms for data collection and using the services offered therein, expressly agrees, in a free, informed and unreserved manner , with the conditions stipulated in this Term and with its clauses, expressing your consent even on the data treatments also specified in this Term. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 3.2. RIAT reserves the right to make changes and updates to the Terms at any time without the need for prior notice. In the event of changes to the Terms restricting the rights of the Service Provider, RIAT may communicate such change, at its discretion, through the Media. However, this liberality does not remove the Service Provider's responsibility to periodically check the Terms. &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt; 3.3. If the Service Provider continues to access the &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Website&lt;/em&gt; through a telephone or computer after any changes to the Terms by RIAT, such act will constitute your consent to link to it refer to the amended Terms. &lt;/p&gt;
